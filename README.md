# WTF

This is a work-in-progress for an open source sample 2D RPG implemented in [Godot](https://godotengine.org). The idea is 
to eventually have something that can be used as a base plugin to develop different RPGs but since I'm learning Godot as I go, 
currently this is a simple demo RPG with the idea to develop:

- Movement.
- Conversations.
- Combat (turn based ala XCom).
- Inventory.
- Maps using [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled).
- Leveling up.
- ...et cetera.
